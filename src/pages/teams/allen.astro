            While planning to compete as a B-class team for the 2025/2026
            season, Casey and Josh emphasize player development, hard work, and
            teamwork throughout their practice and tournament schedules.
            Practices are typically 2 nights per week through the fall, winter,
            and spring, with 3-4 fall tournaments and 8-10 spring/summer
            tournaments on their schedule. They believe that consistent effort
            and a strong team culture are key to helping athletes reach their
            full potential.
