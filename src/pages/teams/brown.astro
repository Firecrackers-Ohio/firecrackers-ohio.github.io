            Together, this coaching staff is committed to building hard-working,
            passionate, and fundamentally sound athletes. Their goal is to
            foster an environment where players compete at a high level, love
            the game, and grow both on and off the field. The Firecrackers 10U
            team will compete at the B-Level, practicing 1-2 times per week
            throughout the fall and winter along with participating in 2-3
            tournaments, with spring and summer seasons practicing 2 times per
            week and playing in 7-9 tournaments.
