          <p class="body-text">
            At Firecrackers Ohio, our mission is to provide our athletes with
            exceptional training that fosters both athletic excellence and
            personal growth. We are committed to developing confident,
            respectful, and resilient young women—on and off the field.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            Rooted in professionalism, self-respect, and respect for others, our
            program empowers each player to embrace her individuality, believe
            in her abilities, and play the game with passion and purpose. At the
            same time, we emphasize the power of teamwork—recognizing that true
            success is built through collaboration, shared effort, and a deep
            commitment to one another.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            To be a Firecracker is to know your worth, trust in your potential,
            and understand that your strength is amplified by the team around
            you. It means striving to make choices that lead to lifelong
            happiness—both in softball and in life.

          The Central Ohio Firecrackers foster a team culture that is tightly
          knit, family-oriented, and grounded in mutual support. We believe in a
          "work hard, play hard" mentality—where competitive drive is matched by
          laughter, camaraderie, and lasting friendships. Our players, coaches,
          and families are all in this together, committed to one another's
          growth on and off the field. We lift each other up, celebrate each
          other's wins, and never let anyone fall behind. It's more than
          softball—it's a united team built on encouragement, effort, and shared
          purpose.
