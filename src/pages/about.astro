            The Central Ohio Firecrackers foster a team culture that is tightly
            knit, family-oriented, and grounded in mutual support. We believe in
            a "work hard, play hard" mentality—where competitive drive is
            matched by laughter, camaraderie, and lasting friendships. Our
            players, coaches, and families are all in this together, committed
            to one another's growth on and off the field. We lift each other up,
            celebrate each other's wins, and never let anyone fall behind. It's
            more than softball—it's a united team built on encouragement,
            effort, and shared purpose.
