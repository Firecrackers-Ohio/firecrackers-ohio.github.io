            exceptional training that fosters both athletic excellence and

            Rooted in professionalism, self-respect, and respect for others, our
            program empowers each player to embrace her individuality, believe
            in her abilities, and play the game with passion and purpose. At the
            same time, we emphasize the power of teamwork—recognizing that true
            success is built through collaboration, shared effort, and a deep
            commitment to one another.

            To be a Firecracker is to know your worth, trust in your potential,

            you. It means striving to make choices that lead to lifelong
            happiness—both in softball and in life.

          The Central Ohio Firecrackers foster a team culture that is tightly
          knit, family-oriented, and grounded in mutual support. We believe in a
          "work hard, play hard" mentality—where competitive drive is matched by
          laughter, camaraderie, and lasting friendships. Our players, coaches,
          and families are all in this together, committed to one another's
          growth on and off the field. We lift each other up, celebrate each
          other's wins, and never let anyone fall behind. It's more than
          softball—it's a united team built on encouragement, effort, and shared
          purpose.
